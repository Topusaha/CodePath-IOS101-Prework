## Notes


An App I would like to develop during the course is something around data. I am a data scientists and thats where my expierence lies. 
I would like to use that knowledge and expand on it with app development to build an app around data. Maybe it will be an app that lets you 
take pictures of flowers and it'll show you what kind of flower it is.
